        Chandler is quite outspoken with his quick, sarcastic comments 
        as he constantly jokes around and pokes fun of his friends. 
        His wittiness is certainly his most defining trait. 
        Although he was the most financially stable out of all the Friends, 
        he was the one to quit his career to follow what he really wants to do â€“ which takes courage! 
        He is a very loving and loyal partner, and is definitely fun to be around. 
        Mr Bing is very creative and energetic, which makes it impossible to leave him unnoticed. 
        Even though his jokes can be a little inappropriate, everyone loves his sense of humour.
